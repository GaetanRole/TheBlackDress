"The Black Dress" is a Unity3D project for mobile devices.
This game is an escape runner with a storyline based on horror events. You play a character called Melody, a little girl who wants to escape from a house.

For its first version, basics mechanics where implemented.
Indeed, an intelligent camera follows Melody with some animations (to turn right/left, to walk up stairs), you can only use left/right controls.

For the next version, a new map will be created with many interactive objects which will allow Melody to hide.
